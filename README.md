# Ask-for-a-date-app
🚀 Deployed "Ask for a Date" App on Docker with Nginx! 🐳

As part of my DevOps journey, I worked on a mini-project to containerize and deploy a simple "Ask for a Date" app using Docker. The goal was to make the app portable, scalable, and easy to deploy across environments.

🔹 Tech Stack Used:
✅ Docker – Containerization for easy deployment
✅ Nginx – Used as a reverse proxy for better performance and security

📌 Key Learnings:
👉 Building and optimizing a Dockerfile
👉 Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy for handling requests
👉 Exposing ports and managing networking inside Docker
👉 Deploying on a local environment for testing

🔥 Next Steps:
🔜 Adding Kubernetes for orchestration
